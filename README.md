## HOW TO USE   
This is a little trickier part as the project requires you to set up a webcam in a specific angle at a specific height and distance. Also  stronger the light, the better the performance. 
#### STUFF YOU WILL REQUIRE 
1. webcam or you can use third-party tools for webcam. 
2. Two A4-sized white paper, horizontally joined together. 2 rectangles need to be drawn at both ends of the paper with a black marker, thicker lines yield better results. 
3. The recommended position for the webcam will be such that it can capture the finger and shadow beneath the finger and should have both boxes we drew on joined paper in the FOV of the camera.
Just like shown in the demo video.
4. A light source in front, ie. behind the camera would be preferred. Casting sharp shadows.
4. Hand with all fingers.

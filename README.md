# CV-piano
Project source code from https://github.com/Mayuresh1611/Paper-Piano

## Setting up project
Python version 3.11 and above
1. Clone the repository ```git clone https://github.com/Mayuresh1611/Paper-Piano.git```
2. run command ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` in the command line.
3. Execute ```run.py``` file

## HOW TO USE   
This is a little trickier part as the project requires you to set up a webcam in a specific angle at a specific height and distance. Also  stronger the light, the better the performance. 
#### STUFF YOU WILL REQUIRE 
1. webcam or you can use third-party tools for webcam. 
2. Two A4-sized white paper, horizontally joined together. 2 rectangles need to be drawn at both ends of the paper with a black marker, thicker lines yield better results. 
3. The recommended position for the webcam will be such that it can capture the finger and shadow beneath the finger and should have both boxes we drew on joined paper in the FOV of the camera.
Just like shown in the demo video.
4. A light source in front, ie. behind the camera would be preferred. Casting sharp shadows.
4. Hand with all fingers.


# Deployed on JETSON NANO
It is recommended to burn a new SD card and to configure the environment directly in the system environment.  
**Configuration environment:** `JetPack4.6.1, Cuda10.2, Python3.6.9`  
## MediaPipe installation
Priority installation of [MediaPipe](https://github.com/google/mediapipe) packages. Refer to this [零基础入门Jetson Nano——MediaPipe双版本（CPU+GPU）的安装与使用](https://blog.csdn.net/qq_56548850/article/details/123981579?ops_request_misc=%257B%2522request%255Fid%2522%253A%2522171394895816800213081926%2522%252C%2522scm%2522%253A%252220140713.130102334..%2522%257D&request_id=171394895816800213081926&biz_id=0&utm_medium=distribute.pc_search_result.none-task-blog-2~all~sobaiduend~default-1-123981579-null-null.142^v100^pc_search_result_base7&utm_term=jetson%20nano%20mediapipe&spm=1018.2226.3001.4187)  

## Tensorflow installation  
When installing tensorflow on a Jetson Nano, the dependency library `h5py` installation reports an error.  
Refer to this [jetson nano使用tensorflow时h5py安装报错](https://blog.csdn.net/coco1234_1590/article/details/134476185?ops_request_misc=%257B%2522request%255Fid%2522%253A%2522171410996016800226530774%2522%252C%2522scm%2522%253A%252220140713.130102334..%2522%257D&request_id=171410996016800226530774&biz_id=0&utm_medium=distribute.pc_search_result.none-task-blog-2~all~sobaiduend~default-2-134476185-null-null.142^v100^pc_search_result_base7&utm_term=jetson%20nano%20tensorflow&spm=1018.2226.3001.4187) . You need to download the [h5py-3.1.0.tar.gz](https://github.com/h5py/h5py/releases) file and modify the `setup.py`.  
Change this 
```# Minimum supported versions of Numpy & Cython depend on the Python version
NUMPY_MIN_VERSIONS = [
    # Numpy    Python
    ('1.12',   "=='3.6'"),
    ('1.14.5', "=='3.7'"),
    ('1.17.5', "=='3.8'"),
    ('1.19.3', ">='3.9'"),]
```
to
```
# Minimum supported versions of Numpy & Cython depend on the Python version
NUMPY_MIN_VERSIONS = [
    # Numpy    Python
    # ('1.12',   "=='3.6'"),
    ('1.14.5', "=='3.7'"),
    ('1.17.5', "=='3.8'"),
    ('1.19.3', "=='3.6'"),]
```
Make sure `numpy` version is **1.19.x** and replace `Cython` version with **3.0.0a10**  

```
sudo pip3 install -U Cython==3.0.0a10
sudo python3 ./setup.py install
```
After successfully installing `h5py3.1.0`, download the `Jetpack4.6.1` version of `tensorflow` provided by [nvidia](https://developer.nvidia.cn/embedded/downloads) official website. Installing tensorflow


```
sudo pip install xxx/xxx/xxx.whl
```

## We need to install opencv-python：
Reference [Howto-Install-Mediapipe-in-Jetson-Nano](https://github.com/Melvinsajith/How-to-Install-Mediapipe-in-Jetson-Nano). Since the OpenCV that comes with the Jetson system will cause some problems, opencv needs to be reinstalled here. The `remove` operation is completed after the `install`.
```
 sudo apt-get install python3-opencv 
 sudo apt-get remove python3-opencv
```
